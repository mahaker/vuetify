# Remember to
#    Capitalize the subject line
#    Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#    Do not end the subject line with a period
#    Separate subject from body with a blank line (comments don't count)
#    Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#    Can use multiple lines with "-" for bullet points in body
#
# If you can't summarize your changes in a single line, they should
# probably be split into multiple commits
